1. GUIDE THE EMPLOYEES based on the some content like what do you see yourself in this organization and in how many years?it will recommend(workshops, training) and other stuff and guide the user on what path to take based on the links provided 

2. it will PROVIDE CONTENT like (links for documents,links of videos) so they can learn the content so they can achieve their goals 
3. USER QUESTIONS (for better understanding)(RAG system) this will use the links and use the rag system to answer the questions (if the user does not understand some concepts the project will help it understand)
